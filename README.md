# MathLiterature
This is a collection of some ideas that I had in mathematics. I use repository as a personal blog in hopes that others in search of truth may find some of these ideas interesting. I encourage every reader to subject these writings to scrutiny and reach out to me at ekalika@stevens.edu if they find a mistake.
