This is a collection of some ideas that I had throughout my studies of mathematics. I use this repository as a personal blog in hopes that others in search of truth may find some of these ideas interesting. I encourage every reader to subject these writings to scrutiny and reach out to me at ekalika@stevens.edu if they find a mistake.

My latest post "Block Matrix Formalization" is still in the works. The proof of the Chi-Zeta Bijectivity Theorm has to be rewritten and all subsubsections after subsubsection 1.1.3. are still in the works.
