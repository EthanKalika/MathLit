# MathLit
This is a collection of some ideas that I had throughout my studies of mathematics. I use this repository as a personal blog to store some of these ideas where others can see them. I encourage every reader to subject these to scrutiny and reach out to me at ekalika@stevens.edu if they find a mistake or have questions.
