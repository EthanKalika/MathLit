# MathLiterature
This is a collection of some ideas that I had in mathematics. I use repository as a personal blog in hopes that others in search of truth may find some of these ideas interesting. I encourage every reader to subject these writings to scrutiny and reach out to me at ekalika@stevens.edu if they find a mistake.
My latest post "Block Matrix Formalization" is still in the works. I will be adding a lot more to every section in the comming weeks.
